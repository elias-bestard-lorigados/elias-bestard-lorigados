## üíª Projects:

**Master‚Äôs Thesis:** proposes a methodology to scrap data from an online community, use Network representations to illustrate the structure of the tag system and perform further studies of their properties. This project also presents a ready-to-use prototype that allows performing the distinct stages of the methodology for specific cuts of the Network and it was implemented allowing easy extension of the code. Developing of API.
(Python, Pandas, NetworkX, JavaScript, Network Analysis, Data Scraping, Data Mining, Data Visualization, Research)

**Movement Control Methods for Mobile Devices**: An Empirical Study of Displacement Interfaces: Developed an Android application to complete a user study comparing four displacement interfaces on mobile devices. Conducted a multivariable analysis of the data obtained in the fields: Human-Computer Interaction, Mobile Development, Mobile User Interfaces, and Data Analysis. (Java, Android, Data Analysis, Research)

**Mining Novel Corona Virus 2019 Dataset**: Mined specific patterns of the virus' distribution among different populations extracting association rules. The main stages of Data Mining were applied to do an end-to-end study of the raw data. Three predictive models were trained to foresee the outcome of positive tested COVID-19 patients using KNN, a Multi Layer Perceptron, and a Decision Tree. The results were compared amongst each method using different measurements: accuracy, precision, f1-score, recall and cross validation.
(Python, Pandas, Sklearn, Mlxtend, Association Rules, Data Processing and Querying)

**Network Analysis of e-commerce dataset**: End-to-end analysis of an e-commerce dataset where Network Analysis was used to find different communities of products and customers, to recommend new products to customers and expand sales in different locations. The use of Visualizations helped to show the insights of the networks and the results. (Community Detection, Link Prediction, Python, NetworkX, Pandas, Plotly)

**Software for Visualization of Unstructured Data**: Developed a software that recognized structures in unknown data sets, processed them to extract information, normalized it and showed it in as many relevant charts as possible. (Data Mining, Data Visualization, Python, Research)
